## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users table
users (
  id, email, password_hash, 
  is_jignasa_member, subscription_plan,
  created_at, last_login
)

-- Progress tracking
user_progress (
  user_id, domain_id, resource_id,
  is_completed, is_favorite, completed_at
)

-- Domains and resources
domains (id, name, icon, description)
resources (id, domain_id, title, type, url, description)
```

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Supabase Integration**: Start with simple auth, gradually add features
- **Performance**: Implement lazy loading and optimization early
- **Responsive Design**: Test on multiple devices throughout development

### Content Risks
- **Domain Content**: Create templates early, populate content systematically
- **User Data**: Implement proper backup and recovery procedures

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP features, add enhancements later
- **Dependencies**: Identify critical path items early
- **Testing**: Allocate sufficient time for testing and bug fixes
